# Case study - Wrap kotlin app in Docker container

## What is needed to do to dockerise the app?

We need to find out how to perform some steps without usage of IDE - don't worry, with `Gradle` its piece of cake.

To make things easier, navigate to

` cd application-directory`


### Building

and 

```powershell
## Powershell
./gradlew assemble
```

```bash
## Bash
gradle assembly
```

In case of success We should see screen which looks like `Figure 1.`

### Running

and 

```powershell
## Powershell
./gradlew run
```

```bash
## Bash
gradle run
```

In case of success We should see screen which looks like `Figure 2.`

### Dockerizin'

Lets prepare `dockerfile`

> dockerfile
```dockerfile
# Let's use JDK11 with gradle image - from https://hub.docker.com/_/gradle
FROM gradle:6.8.3-jdk11

# Set current working directory to App
WORKDIR /app

# Change owner of file to avoid errors and copy 
COPY --chown=gradle:gradle . /app

# Application network port there
EXPOSE 8080

# Let's build app 
RUN gradle assemble

# Let's start app
CMD [ "gradle", "run" ]

```

To create image from local filesystem we need to build it using: 

` docker build . -t my-app`

Output should looks like `Figure 3.`

#### Try to run

```powershell
                  # switch -p (publish) create a firewall rule which maps port inside container to host
docker run my-app -p 8080:8080
```
